Okay, creating a good README is crucial for any project, especially for a hackathon submission or an open-source project. It should clearly explain what the project is, how to set it up, how to use it, and acknowledge its current state/limitations.

Since you have two repositories (the main Next.js app and the FastAPI ML service), you'll ideally have a README in each. The main repo's README will be more comprehensive and link to the ML service.

Let's draft a README for your main StoxSight Next.js application repository (https://github.com/MJ665/StoxSight).

StoxSight ðŸ“ˆðŸ§ ðŸ”—

AI and Blockchain-Powered Predictive Analytics for Secure Stock and Crypto Markets

StoxSight is a B.Tech project aiming to provide users with advanced stock and cryptocurrency market analysis by leveraging Artificial Intelligence for predictive insights and (planned) Blockchain technology for data integrity. This application integrates data from various sources, processes it through sophisticated ML models, and delivers qualitative and quantitative analysis to aid in investment decision-making.

Live Demo (Frontend): [YOUR_NEXTJS_APP_VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_URL_HERE] (e.g., https://stox-sight.vercel.app)
ML Service API (Backend): https://mj665-stox-sight-ml-service.hf.space

Features

LLM-Powered Stock Analysis: Get in-depth qualitative analysis and structured insights for Indian stocks based on user queries, fundamental data (from Screener.in), and market data (from NSE India).

Multi-Model ML Predictions (via separate ML Service):

Accepts historical stock data (CSV).

Trains LSTM, GRU, Transformer, and Polynomial Regression models.

Performs hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

Generates future price predictions.

Produces a comprehensive PDF report with model results, plots, and AI-driven qualitative analysis.

Sends the PDF report via email.

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and sign-in using Google and Email/Password (NextAuth.js).

Database Integration: User data, analysis requests, and results are stored using Prisma and PostgreSQL.

(Planned) Blockchain Integration: For tamper-proof logging of critical financial events or predictions.

2. Trigger ML Service for Prediction & Report

Endpoint: POST /api/mlService (This Next.js route prepares data and calls the FastAPI ML service)

Purpose: Fetches historical data for a stock, saves it to a temporary CSV, and then calls the separate FastAPI ML service to train models (LSTM, GRU, Transformer, Poly), generate predictions, create plots, and a PDF report. The request and a summary of the ML service's response are stored in the PredictionRun table.

Request Body (JSON):

{
  "stockSymbol": "STOCK_SYMBOL",
  "market": "INDIA",
  "email": "user_email_for_report@example.com",
  "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD"
